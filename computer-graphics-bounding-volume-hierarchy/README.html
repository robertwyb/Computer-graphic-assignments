<h3 id="objectpartitioning">Object partitioning</h3>

<p>In this assignment, you will build an Axis-Aligned Bounding-Box
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure">Tree</a> (AABB Tree). This is one of the simplest
instances of an <em>object partitioning</em> scheme, where a group of input objects are
arranged into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume_hierarchy">bounding volume
hierarchy</a>.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/Example_of_bounding_volume_hierarchy.png" alt="In the scene on the left, there are six objects. All objects fit into the
axis-aligned bounding box A (the root of the tree), then we cluster nearby

<figcaption>In the &#8220;scene&#8221; on the left, there are six objects. All objects fit into the
axis-aligned bounding box <strong>A</strong> (the root of the tree), then we cluster nearby
objects into subtrees rooted at <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong>. We continue to apply this
process recursively until leaves of the tree store a single object. Tree shown
on right. (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Example_of_bounding_volume_hierarchy.svg">image

</figure>

<p>In our assignment, we will build a binary tree. Conducting queries on the tree
will be reminiscent of searching for values in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree">binary search
tree</a>. However, objects in our
tree will not be <em>perfectly</em> sorted. In general, the bounding boxes of
&#8220;relatives&#8221; (even siblings) in our tree will overlap spatially.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/more-realistic-bvh-example.png" alt="In most cases, bounding boxes will overlap. The tree topology remains the same

in this case. (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Example_of_bounding_volume_hierarchy.svg">original image

</figure>

<p>By allowing bounding boxes to overlap we avoid the need to geometric split our
objects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> If we use overlapping bounding boxes (i.e., no splitting) to
build an AABB Tree , how many leaves will there be?</p>
</blockquote>

<img src="images/point-cloud-aabb-tree.gif" alt="The AABB Tree around a point cloud starts with a single box. The next level

trees</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree">octrees</a>) divide space <em>perfectly</em> at
each level of the tree, with no overlapping. This makes query code easy to
write, but necessitates splitting of objects that inevitably straddle partition
boundaries.</p>

<h3 id="boundingprimitives">Bounding primitives</h3>

<p>In this assignment, we will use axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) to enclose
groups of objects (e.g., points, triangles, other bounding boxes). In general,
AABBs will <em>not</em> tightly enclose a set of objects. However, operations (e.g.,
growing the bounding box, testing ray-intersection or determining closest-point
distances with an <em>axis-aligned</em> bounding box) usually reduce to trivial
per-component arithmetic. This means the code is simple to write/debug and also
inexpensive to evaluate.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/bounding-primitives.png" alt="Minimal axis-aligned bounding boxes provide a good trade-off between
tightness, ease of construction and ease of query
evaluation." />

<h3 id="ray-intersectionqueries">Ray-intersection queries</h3>

<p>See Section 12.3 of <em>Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th Edition)</em>.</p>

<h3 id="distancequeries">Distance queries</h3>

<p>The recursive algorithm in <em>Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th Edition)</em> for
ray-AABBTree-intersection is essentially performing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">depth first
search</a>. The search usually
doesn&#8217;t have to visit the entire tree because most boxes are not hit by the
given ray. In this way, many search paths are quickly aborted.</p>

<p>On the other hand, using this style of depth-first search for closest point
queries can be a disaster. Every box has <em>some</em> closest point to our query. A
naive depth-first search could end up searching over every box before finding
the one with the smallest query.</p>

<p>Are we just talking about worst-case complexity for pathological arrangements
(e.g., a bunch of overlapping triangles piled at the origin)? No. Even on a
well-balanced, minimally overlapping AABB tree we could end up exploring most of
the leaves before finally finding the leaf containing the true closest point at
the very end.</p>

<p>This implies that we can&#8217;t just explore the left or right subtrees (or their
progeny) in arbitrary order. A quick fix is to peek at the closet distance to
the boxes containing the left and right trees respectively and prefer our depth
first search in the closest direction. This helps, but we still end up
<em>drilling</em> down to leaves when there are potentially entire large subtrees that
are closer. The problem is that depth first search is inherently
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)">stack</a>-based and we
really want to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue">priority
queue</a> to explore the current best
looking path in our tree wherever it might be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Hey! Where&#8217;s the stack in depth first search? I implemented it
using recursion, there&#8217;s no <code>#include &lt;stack&gt;</code> in my code!</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">Hint</a>:</strong> Where are the instructions and data of your program stored?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">Breadth-first search</a> is a
much better structure for distance queries on a spatial acceleration
data-structure. Pseudo-code for a closest distance algorithm might look like:</p>

<pre><code>// initialize a queue prioritized by minimum distance
d_r ← distance to root's box
Q.insert(d_r, root)
// initialize minimum distance seen so far
d ← ∞
while Q not empty 
  // d_s: distance from query to subtree's bounding box
  (d_s, subtree) ← Q.pop
  if d_s &lt; d
    if subtree is a leaf
      d ← min[ d , distance from query to leaf object ]
    else
      d_l ← distance to left's box
      Q.insert(d_l ,subtree.left)
      d_r ← distance to right's box
      Q.insert(d_r ,subtree.right)
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> If I have just a single query to conduct on a set of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>

<h3 id="intersectionqueriesbetweentwotrees">Intersection queries between two trees</h3>

<p>Suppose we want to find <em>all pairs</em> of intersecting triangles between two
meshes. One approach would be to put one mesh&#8217;s triangles in an AABB tree, then
loop over the other mesh&#8217;s triangles using the tree to accelerate intersection
tests. This works well if the mesh in the tree has many more triangles than the
other mesh, but can we do better if both mesh have many triangles? How about
putting both meshes in a AABB trees. If the root bounding boxes don&#8217;t overlap we
find out <em>instantaneously</em> that there are no pairs of intersecting triangles. If
they do overlap, we check their childrens&#8217; boxes against each other. Anytime two
boxes don&#8217;t overlap we save many expensive pairwise triangle checks. A rough
sketch of this algorithm using a simple (i.e., non prioritized) queue is like
this:</p>

<pre><code>// initialize list of candidate leaf pairs
leaf_pairs ← {}
if root_A.box intersects root_B.box
  Q.insert( root_A, root_B )
while Q not empty
  {nodeA,nodeB} ← Q.pop
  if nodeA and nodeB are leaves
    leaf_pairs.insert( node_A, node_B )
  else if node_A is a leaf
    if node_A.box intersects node_B.left.box
      Q.insert( node_A, node_B.left )
    if node_A.box intersects node_B.right.box
      Q.insert( node_A, node_B.right )
  else if node_B is a leaf
    if node_A.left.box intersects node_B.box
      Q.insert( node_A.left, node_B)
    if node_A.right.box intersects node_B.box
      Q.insert( node_A.right, node_B)
  else
    if node_A.left.box intersects node_B.left.box
      Q.insert( node_A.left, node_B.left )
    if node_A.left.box intersects node_B.right.box
      Q.insert( node_A.left, node_B.right )
    if node_A.right.box intersects node_B.right.box
      Q.insert( node_A.right, node_B.right )
    if node_A.right.box intersects node_B.left.box
      Q.insert( node_A.right, node_B.left )
</code></pre>

<p>Careful, this sketch only considers a perfectly filled tree where nodes (and
their left/right children) are never null pointers. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/your_mileage_may_vary">Your trees may
vary</a>.</p>

<p>This <em><strong>broad phase</strong></em> identifies a set of overlapping bounding boxes containing
one triangle each. The broad phase is quick because it uses the bounding volume
hierarchy for acceleration and intersection between bounding boxes is a simple
and fast. The list of candidate pairs scales with the number of <em>actual
intersections</em> rather than the number of input triangles (as brute force
double-for loops does). This list can then be processed using the (expensive)
triangle-triangle intersection test in a <strong><em>narrow phase</em></strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Suppose we want to detect intersections for a simulation of two
deforming meshes (e.g., elastic solids bumping into each other). Can we reuse
our AABB Tree even if the meshes are deforming? What if they&#8217;re just moving
rigidly (rotations and translations)?</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Is an axis-aligned box still axis-aligned if it&#8217;s rotated 45°?</p>

<p>Never conduct performance evaluations in debug mode. To set up a &#8220;release&#8221; mode

<p>In this assignment, we&#8217;re aiming to improve the asymptotic complexity for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average-case_complexity">average case</a>. We will
not formalize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution">probability
distribution</a> of inputs,
but instead consider uniformly random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud">point
clouds</a> or real-world surface models.
The AABB Tree algorithms should behave like <span class="math">\(O(\log{n})\)</span> compared to brute
force <span class="math">\(O(n)\)</span> algorithms. For large inputs the difference should be striking.</p>
