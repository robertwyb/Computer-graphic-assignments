<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<h3 id="readsections4.1-4.4offundamentalsofcomputergraphics4thedition.">Read Sections 4.1&#8211;4.4 of <em>Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th Edition)</em>.</h3>

<p><em>We will cover basic shading, shadows and reflection in the next assignment.</em></p>

<h3 id="sceneobjects">Scene Objects</h3>

<p>This assignment will introduce a few <em>primitives</em> for 3D geometry:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere">spheres</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)">planes</a> and triangles. We&#8217;ll
get a first glimpse that more complex shapes can be created as a collection of
these primitives.</p>

<p>The core interaction that we need to start visualizing these shapes is
ray-object intersection. A ray emanating from a point <span class="math">\(\mathbf{e} ‚àà \mathbb{R}¬≥\)</span>
(e.g., a camera&#8217;s &#8220;eye&#8221;) in a direction <span class="math">\(\mathbf{d} ‚àà \mathbb{R}¬≥\)</span> can be
<em>parameterized</em> by a single number <span class="math">\(t ‚àà [0,‚àû)\)</span>. Changing the value of <span class="math">\(t\)</span> picks
a different point along the ray. Remember, a ray is a 1D object so we only need
this one &#8220;knob&#8221; or parameter to move along it. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation">parametric
function</a> for a ray written
in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_notation">vector notation</a> is:</p>

<p>$$
\mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{e} + t\mathbf{d}.
$$</p>

<p>For each object in our scene we need to find out:</p>

<ol>
<li>is there some value <span class="math">\(t\)</span> such that the ray <span class="math">\(\mathbf{r}(t)\)</span> lies on the
 surface of the object?</li>
<li>if so, what is that value of <span class="math">\(t\)</span> (and thus what is the position of
 intersection <span class="math">\(\mathbf{r}(t)‚àà\mathbb{R}¬≥\)</span></li>
<li>and what is the surface&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector">unit</a>
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry)">normal vector</a> at the
 point of intersection.</li>
</ol>

<p>For each object, we should carefully consider how <em>many</em> ray-object
intersections are possible for a given ray (always one? sometimes two? ever
zero?) and in the presence of multiple answers choose the closest one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why keep the closest hit?</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> ü§¶üèª</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this assignment, we&#8217;ll use simple representations for primitives. For
example, for a plane we&#8217;ll store a point on the plane and the normal anywhere on
the plane.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How many numbers are needed to uniquely determine a plane?</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> A point position (3) + normal vector (3) is too many. Consider how
many numbers are needed to specify a line in 2D.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="camera">Camera</h3>

<p>In this assignment we will pretend that our &#8220;camera&#8221; or &#8220;eye&#8221; looking into the
scene is shrunk to a single 3D point <span class="math">\(\mathbf{e} ‚àà \mathbb{R}¬≥\)</span> in space. The
image rectangle (e.g., 640 pixels by 360 pixels) is placed so the image center
is directly <em>in front</em> of the
&#8220;eye&#8221; point at a certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_length">&#8220;focal
length&#8221;</a> <span class="math">\(d\)</span>. The image of pixels is
scaled to match the given <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> defined by the <code>camera</code>. Camera
is equipped with a direction that moves left-right across the image
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{u}\)</span>, up-down <span class="math">\(\mathbf{v}\)</span>, and from the &#8220;eye&#8221; to the image
<span class="math">\(-\mathbf{w}\)</span>. Keep in mind that the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are measure in the
units of the <em>scene</em>, not in the number of pixels. For example, we can fit a
1024x1024 image into a camera with width <span class="math">\(=1\)</span> and height <span class="math">\(=1\)</span>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Given that <span class="math">\(\mathbf{u}\)</span> points right and <span class="math">\(\mathbf{v}\)</span> points up,
why does <em>minus</em> <span class="math">\(\mathbf{w}\)</span> point into the scene?</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> ‚òùÔ∏è</p>

<h3 id="trianglesoup">Triangle Soup</h3>

<p>Triangles are the simplest 2D polygon. On the computer we can represent a
triangle efficiently by storing its 3 corner positions. To store a triangle
floating in 3D, each corner position is stored as 3D position.</p>

<p>A simple, yet effective and popular way to approximate a complex shape is to
store list of (many and small) triangles covering the shape&#8217;s surface. If we
place no assumptions on these triangles (i.e., they don&#8217;t have to be connected
together or non-intersecting), then we call this collection a &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_soup">triangle
soup</a>&#8221;. </p>

<p>When considering the intersection of a ray and a triangle soup, we simply need
to find the <em>first</em> triangle in the soup that the ray intersects first.</p>

<h3 id="falsecolorimages">False color images</h3>

<p>Our scene does not yet have light so the only accurate rendering would be a
pitch black image. Since this is rather boring, we&#8217;ll create false or pseudo
renderings of the information we computed during ray-casting.</p>

<h4 id="objectidimage">Object ID image</h4>

<p>The simplest image we&#8217;ll make is just assigning each object to a color. If a
pixel&#8217;s closest hit comes from the <span class="math">\(i\)</span>-th object then we paint it with the <span class="math">\(i\)</span>-th
rgb color in our <code>color_map</code>.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/sphere-packing-id.png" alt="This object id image shows which object is closest along the ray passing
through each pixel. Each object is assigned to its own unique color." />
<figcaption>This &#8220;object id image&#8221; shows which object is <em>closest</em> along the ray passing
through each pixel. Each object is assigned to its own unique color.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 id="depthimages">Depth images</h4>

<p>The object ID image gives us very little sense of 3D. The simplest image to
encode the 3D geometry of a scene is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_map">depth
image</a>. Since the range of depth is
generally <span class="math">\([d,‚àû)\)</span> where <span class="math">\(d\)</span> is the distance from the camera&#8217;s eye to the camera
plane, we must map this to the range <span class="math">\([0,1]\)</span> to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale">grayscale
image</a>. In this assignment we use a
simple non-linear mapping based on reasonable default values.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/sphere-packing-depth.png" alt="This grayscale depth image shows the distance to the nearest object along
the ray through each pixel. Shorter distances are brighter than farther
distances." />
<figcaption>This grayscale &#8220;depth image&#8221; shows the distance to the nearest object along
the ray through each pixel. Shorter distances are brighter than farther
distances.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 id="normalimages">Normal images</h4>

<p>The depth image technically captures all geometric information visible by
casting rays from the camera, but interesting surfaces will appear dull because
small details will have nearly the same depth. During ray-object intersection
we compute or return the surface normal vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf{n} ‚àà \mathbf{R}¬≥\)</span> at the
point of intersection. Since the normal vector is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector">unit
length</a>, each coordinate value is
between <span class="math">\([-1,1]\)</span>. We can map the normal vector to an rgb value in a linear way
(e.g., <span class="math">\(r = ¬Ω x + ¬Ω\)</span>).</p>

<p>Although all of these images appear cartoonish and garish, together they reveal
that ray-casting can probe important pixel-wise information in the 3D scene.</p>

scene along the ray through each pixel." />

<h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>

<p>In this assignment you will implement core routines for casting rays into a 3D
and collect &#8220;hit&#8221; information where they intersect 3D objects.</p>

<h2 id="whitelist">Whitelist</h2>

<p>This assignment uses the <a href="https://eigen.tuxfamily.org">Eigen</a> for numerical
linear algebra. This library is used in both professional and academic numerical
computing. We will use its <code>Eigen::Vector3d</code> as a double-precision 3D vector
class to store <span class="math">\(x,y,z\)</span> data for 3D points and 3D vectors. You can add (<code>+</code>)
vectors and points together, multiply them against scalars (<code>*</code>) and compute
vector <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot products</a> (<code>a.dot(b)</code>).
In addition, <code>#include &lt;Eigen/Geometry&gt;</code> has useful geometric functions such as
3D vector <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product">cross product</a>
(<code>a.cross(b)</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Mac OS X users can quickly preview the output images using</p>

<pre><code>./raycasting &amp;&amp; qlmanage -p {id,depth,normal}.ppm
</code></pre>

<p>Flicking the left and right arrows will toggle through the results</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> After you&#8217;re confident that your program is working <em>correctly</em>,
you can dramatic improve the performance simply by enabling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimizing_compiler">compiler
optimization</a>: </p>

<pre><code>mkdir build-release
cd build-release
