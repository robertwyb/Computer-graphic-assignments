## Introduction

Welcome to Computer Graphics! The main purpose of this assignment will be to get
you up and running with C++ and the cmake build setup used for our assignments.


### Prerequisite installation

On all platforms, we will assume you have installed cmake and a modern c++
compiler on Mac OS X[¹](#¹macusers), Linux[²](#²linuxusers), or
Windows[³](#³windowsusers).

We also assume that you have cloned this repository using the `--recursive`
flag (if not then issue `git submodule update --init --recursive`). 

### Layout

All assignments will have a similar directory and file layout:

    README.md
    CMakeLists.txt
    main.cpp
    include/
      function1.h
      function2.h
      ...
    src/
      function1.cpp
      function2.cpp
      ...
    data/
      ...
    ...

The `README.md` file will describe the background, contents and tasks of the
assignment.

The `CMakeLists.txt` file setups up the cmake build routine for this
assignment.

The `main.cpp` file will include the headers in the `include/` directory and
link to the functions compiled in the `src/` directory. This file contains the
`main` function that is executed when the program is run from the command line.

The `include/` directory contains one file for each function that you will
implement as part of the assignment. **_Do not change_** these files.

The `src/` directory contains _empty implementations_ of the functions
specified in the `include/` directory. This is where you will implement the
parts of the assignment.

The `data/` directory contains _sample_ input data for your program. Keep in
mind you should create your own test data to verify your program as you write
it. It is not necessarily sufficient that your program _only_ works on the given
sample data.

## Compilation

This and all following assignments will follow a typical cmake/make build
routine. Starting in this directory, issue:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..

If you are using Mac or Linux, then issue:

    make

If you are using Windows, then running `cmake ..` should have created a Visual Studio solution file
called `raster.sln` that you can open and build from there. Building the raster project will generate an .exe file.

Why don't you try this right now?

## Execution

Once built, you can execute the assignment from inside the `build/` using 

    ./raster

## Background

> Every assignment, including this one, will start with a **Background**
> section. This will cite a chapter of the book to read or review the math and
> algorithms behind the task in the assignment. Students following the lectures
> should already be familiar with this material.

### Read Chapter 3 of _Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th Edition)_.

The most common digital representation of a color image is a 2D array of
red/green/blue intensities at pixels. Since each entry in the array is actually
a 3-vector of color values, we can interpret an image as a 3-tensor or 3D array.
Memory on the computer is addressed linear, so an RGB image with a certain
`width` and `height` will be represented as `width*height*3` numbers. How these
numbers are ordered is a matter of convention. In our assignment we use the
convention that the red value of pixel in the top-left corner comes first, then
its green value, then its blue value, and then the rgb values of its neighbor to
the right and so on _across_ the row of pixels, and then moving to the next row
_down_ the columns of rows.

> Q: Suppose you have a 767×772 rgb image stored in an array called `data`. How
> would you access the green value at the pixel on the 36th row and 89th
> column?
>
> A: `data[1 + 3*(88+767*35)]` (Remember C++ starts counting with `0`).

### Alpha map

Natural images (e.g., photographs) only require color information, but to
manipulate images it is often useful to also store a value representing how much
of a pixel is "covered" by the given color. Intuitively this value (called alpha
or $α$[⁴](#⁴latex)) represents how opaque (the opposite of _transparent_) each pixel is.
When we store rgb + α image as a _4_-channel rgba image. Just like rgb images,
rgba images are 3D arrays unrolled into a linear array in memory.

.png files can store rgba images, whereas our simpler .ppm file format only
stores grayscale or rgb images.

### .ppm files

We'll use a very basic _uncompressed_ image file format to write out the results
of our tasks: the [.ppm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format#File_format_description).

Like many image file formats, .ppm uses 8 bits per color value. Color
intensities are represented as an integer between `0` (0% intensity) and `255`
(100% intensity). In our programs we will use `unsigned char` to represent these
values when reading, writing and doing simple operations. For numerically
sensitive computations (e.g., conversion between rgb and hsv), it is convenient
to convert values to decimal representations using [double precision floating
point
numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)
`0` is converted to `0.0` and `255` to `1.0`.

## Grayscale Images

Surprisingly there are
[many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale#Converting_color_to_grayscale)
acceptable and reasonable ways to convert a color image into a
[grayscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale) ("black and white") image.
The complexity of each method scales with the amount that method accommodates
for human perception. For example, a very naive method is to average red, green
and blue intensities. A slightly better (and very popular method) is to take a
weighted average giving higher priority to green: 

$$
i = 0.2126 r + 0.7152 g + 0.0722 b.
$$

## Mosaic images

The raw color measurements made by modern digital cameras are typically stored
with a single color channel per pixel. This information is stored as a seemingly
1-channel image, but with an understood convention for interpreting each pixel
as the red, green or blue intensity value given some pattern. The most common is
the [Bayer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter).  In this
assignment, we'll assume the top left pixel is green, its right neighbor is blue
and neighbor below is red, and its
[kitty-corner](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kitty-corner#Adverb) neighbor is
also green.

> Q: Why are more sensors devoted to green?
>
> Hint: 🐒

To _demosaic_ an image, we would like to create a full rgb image without
downsampling the image resolution. So for each pixel, we'll use the exact color
sample when it's available and average available neighbors (in all 8 directions)
to fill in missing colors. This simple [linear
interpolation-based](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~majumder/PHOTO/DemosaicingAndWhiteBalancing.pdf)
method has some blurring artifacts and can be improved with more complex
methods.

![The Bayer-pattern image on the left has "exact" measurements of red, green and
blue colors at different pixels. The missing color information at each pixel
needs to be interpolated from neighbors (4 or 2). _Just do "something
reasonable" for pixels on the very boundary of the image._ [image source](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~majumder/PHOTO/DemosaicingAndWhiteBalancing.pdf) ](images/bayer.png)

## Color representation

RGB is just one way to represent a color. Another useful representation is store
the [hue, saturation, and value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) of a
color. This "hsv" representation also has 3-channels: typically, the
[hue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue) or `h` channel is stored in degrees
(i.e., on a periodic scale) in the range $[0°,360°]$ and the
[saturation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorfulness) `s` and
[value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightness) `v` are given as absolute
values in $[0,1]$.

[Converting between rgb and
hsv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV#Converting_to_RGB) is
straightforward and makes it easy to implement certain image changes such as
shifting the hue of an image (e.g., Instagram's "warmth" filter) and the
saturation of an image (e.g., Instagram's "saturation" filter).

## Tasks

### Groundrules

Implementations of nearly any task you're asked to implemented in this course
can be found online. Do not copy these and avoid _googling for code_; instead,
search the internet for explanations. Many topics have relevant wikipedia
articles. Use these as references. Always remember to cite any references in
your comments.

#### White List

Feel free and encouraged to use standard template library functions in `#include
<algorithm>` and `#include <cmath>` such as `std::fmod` and `std::fabs`.


### `src/rgba_to_rgb.cpp`

Extract the 3-channel rgb data from a 4-channel rgba image.

### `src/write_ppm.cpp`

Write an rgb or grayscale image to a .ppm file.

At this point, you should start seeing output files:

 - `bayer.ppm`
 - `composite.ppm`
 - `demosaicked.ppm`
 - `desaturated.ppm`
 - `gray.ppm`
 - `reflected.ppm`
 - `rgb.ppm`
 - `rotated.ppm`
 - `shifted.ppm`

![If you've implemented `src/rgba_to_rgb.cpp` correctly then `./raster
../data/dog.png` should produce this image in
`rgb.ppm`.](images/rgb.png) 

### `src/reflect.cpp`

Horizontally reflect an image (like a mirror)

![If you've implemented `src/write_ppm.cpp` correctly then `./raster
../data/dog.png` should produce this image in
`reflected.ppm`.](images/reflected.png) 

### `src/rotate.cpp`

Rotate an image 90°  counter-clockwise

![`./raster

### `src/simulate_bayer_mosaic.cpp`

Simulate an image acquired from the Bayer mosaic by taking a 3-channel rgb image
and creating a single channel grayscale image composed of interleaved
red/green/blue channels. The output image should be the same size as the input but only one
channel.

![`./raster
../data/dog.png` should produce this image in
`bayer.ppm`. **Zoom in** to see interleaving.](images/bayer.png) 

### `src/demosaic.cpp`

Given a mosaiced image (interleaved GBRG colors in a single channel), created a
3-channel rgb image.

![`./raster ../data/dog.png` should produce this image in
`demosaicked.ppm`.](images/demosaicked.png)

representation using hue, saturation and value.

### `src/hsv_to_rgb.cpp`

Convert a color represented by hue, saturation and value to its representation
using red, green and blue intensities.

### `src/hue_shift.cpp`

Shift the hue of a color rgb image. 

Hint: Use your `rgb_to_hsv` and `hsv_to_rgb` functions.
